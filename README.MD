# Go HTTP Server

A simple HTTP server implemented from scratch in **Go**.  

This project is part of a learning exercise to understand how the **HTTP/1.1 protocol** works at a low level. Instead of using frameworks, we handle TCP connections, parse HTTP requests, and send responses manually.  

By building this, you'll learn:  
- How TCP connections work  
- How HTTP requests and responses are structured  
- How web servers serve content  
- The basics of routing and headers
